Dinner table seating to maximize happiness.

This is mostly the same problem as day 9, part b, with the following two
differences.

1. Instead of a single metric between nodes, there are two which need to be
added to get a final value. That is easily done in the input stage.

2. We need to end where we started. That is just one extra addition from the
last back to the first in the innermost loop.

I just copiied the day 9 code and made the necessary changes. 

Note that in both the problems, the inputs are arranged just as one would
like for reading into an array. Thus, it is unnecessary to parse any of the
names, just pick out the numbers from each line.

The second part just requires that the smallest one of the pairwise values be
discarded. I note that total happpiness decreased when I did this.
Corollary: everyone would be happier if I ate in the kitchen.
