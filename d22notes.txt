Killing the boss with magic spells

To get part b, compile something like
gcc -D PARTB -O2 -o d22b d22a.c

Typical game programming with a mv() routine to move the player and a mvb()
routine to move the boss, calling each other recursively. The game state is
kept in a struct which is passed by value so we don't need to save anything
across function calls.
