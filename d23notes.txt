A computer designed for the Collatz Conjecture
see https://wikipedia.org/en/Collatz_conjecture

The problem itself is straightforward; parse the input into an intermediate
form and the execute it on a virtual machine. The hardest part is reading
the problem so that one doesn't think jio must be jump if odd just as jie is
jump if even.

I think I first ran across this 40+ years ago as one of the problems in one
of Knuth's books. He stated that the solution would be worth at least a PhD.
I see it still has not been proved, though (perhaps) some progress is being
made.
