Updating rather insecure passwords

There is no d11a.txt; my old password was "vzbxkghb".

I did this one by hand, after noting

1. I'd like to leave the first 3 letters alone to whatever extent is
possible.

2. I can fulfill rules 1 and 3 in 5 letters of the form sstuu.

Noting the x in position 4 the next password must be "vzbxxyzz".

For the next password, it's necessary to increment the 'b' in position 3 to
be a 'c'. The next valid password will be "vzcaabcc".

Since this is the Advent of Code, not the Advent of Logical Thinking, I did
write a simple program to solve this also.
