Balancing Santa's sleigh and quantum disentangling it

I simplified this by looking at my data. In part a with 3 compartments, it
would require at least 5 presents to make up 1/3 the weight. However, since
all the presents had odd weights, and 1/3 the weight was even, I needed at
least 6. So I looked for all the ways to pick 6 presents from 28, checked
for correct weight, and calculated QE for all configurations with the
correct weight.

Part b was similar, except that 4 presents would have been enough. Similarly
to part a (in a converse sort of way), 1/4 the total was odd so I actually
needed 5 presents.

I didn't worry about the other 2 or 3 compartments, since I was confident
that with more presents in each there would be plenty of ways to balance the
weights.
