Kill the Boss, Litle Henry (#1)

Another problem that I solved without a program. The program took longer
to write than working out the answer with pencil and paper.

If either player gets more hit points per turn, they will win.

If they get the same number of hit points, the array ww contains 0 if the
boss wins, 1 otherwise.  For my data, the boss wins for 1-6 hits per turn,
and I win for 7-9;

I then loop through all the possible things I can legally buy and see who
wins. The only obscure part is the rings, where you can buy 0, 1 or 2. The
double index on r1 and r2 find all the cases since the array has 2 zeros in
it.
