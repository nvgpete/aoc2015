Finding adventcoins by calculating MD5 hashes

There is no d04a.txt data file since the input, "yzbqklnj" was short enough
to just embed in the program.

I have written all of the code for these puzzles in c because that is where I
am most comfortable. However, even I will admit c was not the best choice
for this problem. Since I am not going to write a MD5 hasher myself, I need
to find what c provides. The crypto library does provide MD5(), but it is
not particularly convenient to use. It requires unsigned *char while most
other string functions require *char so there will need to be some casting
done to avaoid compiler complaints. It also returns a 16 byte binary array
rather than 32 bytes of hex which would be more useful for this problem.
(Thus the odd condition in my while() statement.) You will also need to
compile with something like
gcc -O2 -l crypto -o d04a d04a.c 

Just to prove I could do it, there is also a php version which will run as
./d04a.php if php is installed. The php version is shorter and quite a bit
more readable. The php version is only about 10% slower since most of the
time is spent in the MD5 code which will be the same regardless of the
language.
